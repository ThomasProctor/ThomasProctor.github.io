Research and Professional Experience
====================================

Freelance Data Scientist
---------------------
Feb. 2017 -- Present

-   Built algorithm for natural language processing of job postings.

-   Built modular library allowing quick project development and easy
    maintenance.

-   Deployed scraping programs for long term usage on AWS using Docker
    to allow clients to run my software with minimal IT support.

Data Scientist -- Scorely
-------------------------
Dec. 2016 -- Feb. 2017

-   Built out data pipeline to evaluate credit-worthiness of businesses.

-   Scraped \~200GB of data from government websites using Requests,
    Beautiful Soup, and Selenium, and processed irregular HTML files
    into clean JSON.

Research Assistant -- CUNY-Lehman College
-----------------------------------------
June 2011 -- Sept. 2015

-   Designed algorithms in Mathematica and Python to model statistical
    physics systems such as random ferromagnets and analyze 10GB of
    data.

-   By parallelizing algorithm, reduced processing time by a factor of
    15, making previously unsolvable problems quickly accessible.

-   Expanded, maintained, and took ownership of code over four years to
    explore related problems.

-   Collaborated with two other group members on random magnet research.

-   Developed theory and methods for five published papers.

-   Presented random magnet research at physics conferences.

-   Provided key theoretical solution to a paradox that had vexed
    physicists since the 1980’s

-   Published paper in PRL, considered the most prestigious physics
    journal.

Adjunct Lecturer -- CUNY-Lehman College
---------------------------------------
Sept. 2011 -- June 2015

-   Mentored high school and university level students one-on-one,
    studying problems in ferromagnetism.

-   Created learning and research plan for mentees and helped them
    present their findings.

-   Developed program for high schoolers to teach ferromagnetism and
    Python.

-   Led physics lab, communicated lab concepts and answered students’
    questions.

Programmer -- Perfectly Scientific, Inc.
----------------------------------------
Aug. 2009 -- Jan. 2010

-   Working for a small software company, built a C implementation of an
    algorithm for solving matrix equations as part of a mathematical
    software suite.

-   Learned Fortran for the purpose of this project.

Drop-in Center Tutor -- Reed College Tutoring Center
----------------------------------------------------
2007 -- 2009

-   Aided students with physics homework problems; communicated complex
    ideas to struggling students.

Education
=========

Data Science Intensive -- SlideRule
-----------------------------------
Nov. 2015 -- Apr. 2016

-   Wrote programs in R, Python, and PostgreSQL to predict taxi
    drop-offs in a given area of NYC based on demographic and geographic
    data using Poisson regression and F-score feature selection on 20GB
    of data.

-   Published non-technical blog post on the SlideRule blog summarizing
    findings.

-   Completed projects using data analytics methods and machine
    learning, including regression, classification, GLMs, random forest,
    Spark, logistic regression, K-means clustering, backpropogated
    neural networks, PCA, mySQL, among others.
