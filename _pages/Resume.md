----------------------------------------
White Plains, NY

February 2020 -- February 2021

  - Working for a small startup, built models of CNA job success.

  - Designed model's dependent variables based on client interviews.

  - Imputed demographic data missing from data sources to evaluate fairness of algorithm.

  - Worked with web development team to incorporate my code into website backend.

  - Worked with web design team to design forms to gather data necessary for model.



Data Scientist -- eScholar LLC
---------------------------------
White Plains, NY

June 2018 -- September 2020

  - Model student success from course data to provide personalized guidance.
  - Improved model ROC-AUC by 10%, creating a model that gives useful results.
  - Implemented propensity score matching to identify causal course relationships.
  - Designed Docker containers to work effectively with an air-gapped system.
  - Contribute to product meetings in planning and marketing new product.

Freelance Data Scientist
---------------------
New York, NY

May 2016 -- February 2020

  - Diverse projects for six different clients.

  - Currently working on long-term projects with IAG Energy and Cleared Careers.

  -  Grouped NYC buildings by owners based on addresses scraped from PDFs, as well as dozens of other address sources.

  - Built algorithm for natural language processing of job postings.
  - Built modular libraries for quick project development and easy maintenance.

  - Deployed scraping programs for long term usage on AWS using Docker to allow clients to run my software with minimal IT support.


Research Assistant -- CUNY-Lehman College
-----------------------------------------
June 2011 -- Sept. 2015

-   Designed algorithms in Mathematica and Python to model statistical
    physics systems such as random ferromagnets and analyze 10GB of
    data.

-   By parallelizing algorithm, reduced processing time by a factor of
    15, making previously unsolvable problems quickly accessible.

-   Expanded, maintained, and took ownership of code over four years to
    explore related problems.

-   Collaborated with two other group members on random magnet research.

-   Developed theory and methods for five published papers.

-   Presented random magnet research at physics conferences.

-   Provided key theoretical solution to a paradox that had vexed
    physicists since the 1980’s

-   Published paper in PRL, considered the most prestigious physics
    journal.

Adjunct Lecturer -- CUNY-Lehman College
---------------------------------------
Sept. 2011 -- June 2015

-   Mentored high school and university level students one-on-one,
    studying problems in ferromagnetism.

-   Created learning and research plan for mentees and helped them
    present their findings.

-   Developed program for high schoolers to teach ferromagnetism and
    Python.

-   Led physics lab, communicated lab concepts and answered students’
    questions.

Programmer -- Perfectly Scientific, Inc.
----------------------------------------
Aug. 2009 -- Jan. 2010

-   Working for a small software company, built a C implementation of an
    algorithm for solving matrix equations as part of a mathematical
    software suite.

-   Learned Fortran for the purpose of this project.

Data Science Intensive -- SlideRule
-----------------------------------
Nov. 2015 -- Apr. 2016

-   Wrote programs in R, Python, and PostgreSQL to predict taxi
    drop-offs in a given area of NYC based on demographic and geographic
    data using Poisson regression and F-score feature selection on 20GB
    of data.

-   Published non-technical blog post on the SlideRule blog summarizing
    findings.

-   Completed projects using data analytics methods and machine
    learning, including regression, classification, GLMs, random forest,
    Spark, logistic regression, K-means clustering, backpropogated
    neural networks, PCA, mySQL, among others.
