Thomas Proctor is a Sr. data scientist at CredReady, Inc. He spends most of his time exploring the world's data.
He hopes it can tell him something useful.

He got his Ph.D. in physics in 2015.
His research simulated ferromagnets, like the magnets on your fridge, on a molecular-ish level.
He hopes that in 20 years or so it will result magnets that are even stronger than the strongest we have now, but he's not about to bet on it.

When not looking for answers to life's mysteries, he can be found on his bicycle, both in his hometown of New York City, where it's his main source of transportation, and in his travels around the world.
